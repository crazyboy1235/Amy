![Achievements](https://i.imgur.com/2k0UDC2.png)

Amy supports custom achievements, which you can add your own instance of the bot (if you're running a custom instance for a private server), and soon will support admin-configurable achievements as well as default achievements that can be enabled globally (across servers) as well as only within a server.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your hard drive. You'll need [Node 12.x](https://nodejs.org) or another JS code interpreter. Assuming you have Node installed, simply type

```bash
npm install --production
```

and while Node grabs the dependencies for you, move the file in `config/secrets-blank.json` to `config/secrets.json` and replace `token` with your [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then start the application with

```bash
npm start
```

## Support

If you need support, you can start with reference guides and Google searches.

That said, if you have questions, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:gideon@gideontong.com) if you have any questions.
