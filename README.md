## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your hard drive. You'll need [Node 12.x](https://nodejs.org) or another JS code interpreter. Assuming you have Node installed, simply type

```bash
npm install --production
```

and while Node grabs the dependencies for you, move the file in `config/secrets-blank.json` to `config/secrets.json` and replace `token` with your [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then start the application with

```bash
npm start
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/gideontong/Amy/pulls)! I review pull requests thoroughly and would love to see what you can cook up. If you want to just submit an idea instead, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/gideontong/Amy/issues) instead.
