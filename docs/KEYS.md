# Key Setup

So, you might notice that certain files have been .gitignored' so you can't figure out what I'm doing all the time. Great! If you're a veteran programmer I'll give you a hint: I haven't changed the expected output of any file so you could easily reverse engineer my code.

Otherwise, (and, I'm looking at you [@mbuyd](https://github.com/mbuyd) and [@Leo10250](https://github.com/Leo10250)) you could easily steal my code and I ain't about to let that happen. If either [@Brooseidon](https://github.com/Brooseidon) or [@MaximusThe6reat](https://github.com/MaximusThe6reat) steals my code there's not much I can do about it anyways. I can't put *that* much effort into this.

The real deets:

This file will be updated with real documentation after the competition is over.
