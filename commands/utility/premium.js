My name is Gideon Tong (you can click my name above to see a little about me), but I'm a college student just trying to put myself through college.\n\nIf you could support AmyBot with just a few dollars a month, you help me pay for college and in return I'll give you access to a ton of cool features, like:\n\nâ€¢ Educational commands! Get help with chemistry, programming, statistics, and more.\nâ€¢ The stock market: live, real-time data all at your fingertips.\nâ€¢ Fast cooldowns (just a few seconds or less).\nâ€¢ Top-secret supporter-only features. :wink:\n\n[Just click the link above to go to my Patreon, or click here.](https://patreon.com/gideontong)",
