<h1>Timezone Detector</h1>
<p>A simple website by Gideon Tong to detect your TZ timezone.</p>
<p>If it says loading forever, your browser may not support this feature. Side note: unlike most of my websites, this was built in 10 seconds to help to figure out your timezone. It has no fancy features or tracking. Feel free to share it.</p>
<p><u>Your estimated timezone</u></p>
<p id="item">Loading...</p>
<button onclick="copy()">copy</button>
<input type="text" value="" id="copy" style="display:none;">
<script>
let item = "Loading...";
if (!Intl || !Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone) item = "This browser does not support this feature. Try update to a modern browser like Chrome or Firefox.";
try { item = Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone; }
catch { item = "Looks like it failed to load. Your browser seems to support it, but maybe something is broken?"; }
document.getElementById("item").innerHTML = item;
function copy() {
  let box = document.getElementById("copy");
  box.value = item;
  box.select();
  document.execCommand("copy");
}
